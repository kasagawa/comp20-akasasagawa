COMP 20
Anna Kasagawa 
Final Learning Portfolio 

1. This Git repository is a portfolio of my work! It's to showcase all my projects.
2. My favorite assignment was Assignment #2. It was really cool to learn how to use things like the Google Maps API and to make POST request to put information onto the map.
3. I have grown quite a lot. I learned how to use many tools (Git, Postman) and skills (JavaScript, Node.js, HTML5, CSS)that I had never really heard of before. I also learned about producing a product and how you have to constantly be thinking about things like security. 
4. 
	- Security!!! For assignment 4, we found out that just making a product that fulfills its purpose is not enough. Other users can easily modify the content and attack the site.
	- GitHub. It was so important to learn how to track your changes, make branches, and merge with other people's work. I think this was such a valuable skills to learn for our comput 
5. I would to delve deeper into web design and UX. I am currently a UX Research Assisstant and have been learning about how to conduct usability tests and analyze the results. But I would like to learn how to then implmenet those changes.

Thanks for a great semester, Ming!
