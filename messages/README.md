Is it possible to request the data from a different origin from using XMLHttpRequest? 

No, it is not possible to request the data from a different origin. XmLHttpRequest sends HTTP request to a web server. So it needs a server to run. Python is the server, but just opening the file on chrome doesn't run anything, so the request and response doesn't happen.
