Is it possible to request the data from a different origin from using XMLHttpRequest? 
No, it is not possible to request the data from a different origin. The data that is being parsed must
be locally available, and javascript needs a server to run. Python is the server, but just opening
the file on chrome doesn't run anything, so the request and response doesn't happen.
